# Color Speech App
Color Speech App is a Flutter-based mobile application that allows users to change the app's background color by speaking the name of a color. The app utilizes speech recognition to interpret user input and text-to-speech (TTS) to confirm the recognized color or provide feedback when the color is not recognized.

# Features
Speech Recognition: Recognizes spoken color names using the speech_to_text package.

Text-to-Speech Feedback: Provides verbal feedback on the recognized color or error messages using the flutter_tts package.

Dynamic Background Color: Changes the app's background to the recognized color.

Responsive UI: Displays a glowing microphone button while listening for speech input.
